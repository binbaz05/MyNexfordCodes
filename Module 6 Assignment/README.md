# Module 6 Assignment: Fashion MNIST Classification

## Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images in the Fashion MNIST dataset. Implementations are provided in both Python and R.

## Requirements
### Python
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### R
- Keras
- Grid

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the 'Module_6_CNN.py' or 'Module_6_CNN.r'
4. Follow the output for the training process and test accuracy.

## Outputs
- The model predicts the classes for two test images.
- Visualizations include the actual and predicted labels for those images.

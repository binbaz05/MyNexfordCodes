Netflix Movies Data Analysis

This assignment uses python to perform data analysis and visualization on a dataset of Netflix shows and movies. The analysis includes cleaning missing values, generating statistical insights, visualizing data, and integrating a visualization into R.

Features:

1. Data Cleaning: Handles missing values by either filling or dropping them, depending on the column type.
2. Data Exploration: Provides descriptive statistics and insights into the dataset.
3. Visualization: Generates bar charts for most-watched genres and distributions of ratings.
4. Data Preparation: Unzips the dataset if itâ€™s in a .zip file, renaming the extracted file to Netflix_shows_movies.csv.
5. Integration with R: Loads one of the generated visualizations into R for display.


Python Setup:

1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Place the Netflix dataset in the project directory. The dataset can be either a .csv or .zip file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

R Setup:

1. Make sure R is installed on your system.
2. Set the working directory to the location of the .png visualization file generated by the Python program.

Usage: Running the Python Program

1. Open the Python script file netflix_visual.py in your IDE or run it directly from the command line.
    python netflix_visual.py

Running the R Script

After running the Python program, a visualization will be saved as most_watched_genres.png in the project directory.

1. Open the R script file load_png
2. Run the script, which reads the image and displays it.
